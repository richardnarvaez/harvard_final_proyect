## Remote JOBS

This is the final project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. I build a Job finder web inspired in remoteok.com. I think is a very popular web and it have all that I need for Final this final project.


  ### Justification | Distinctiveness and Complexity

  This project is distinct from all previous projects so far. Why?

  - More models with complex relation between them.
  - I create two types of Users (Recluiter & Seeker).
  - Implemented a search based on keywords
  - You can appli for a job, it's different of a commerce or network web
  - In this project I used Tailwind CSS and not Boostrap
  - I inspired in https://remoteok.com and I tried to do a minimalistic design version
  - Completely Mobile responsive.
